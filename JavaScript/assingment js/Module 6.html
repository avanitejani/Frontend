    (Module 6) JAVASCRIPT BASIC & DOM

1• What is JavaScript?
Ans.
JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

3• What is negative Infinity?
Ans.
NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or mathematical function generates a negative value greater than the largest representable number in JavaScript (i.e., more negative than -Number. MAX_VALUE) . JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity

4• Which company developed JavaScript?
Ans.
Netscape Communications
JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.

5• What are undeclared and undefined variables?
Ans.
Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a keyword. 
Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the var or const keyword.

6• Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?
Ans.
document. createElement("<tagName>"); // Where <tagName> can be any HTML // tagName like div, ul, button, etc. // newDiv element has been created For Eg: let newDiv = document. createElement("div"); Once the element has been created, let's move on to the setting of attributes of the newly created element.

document.createElement("<tagName>");  
    // Where <tagName> can be any HTML 
    // tagName like div, ul, button, etc.
    
    // newDiv element has been created
    For Eg: let newDiv = document.createElement("div");
    Once the element has been created, let’s move on to the setting of attributes of the newly created element.

7• What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
Ans.
ViewState	
Maintained at page level only.
View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple pages.	
It will retain values in the event of a postback operation occurring.	
Information is stored on the client’s end only.	
used to allow the persistence of page-instance-specific data.	
ViewState values are lost/cleared when new page is loaded.	

SessionState
Maintained at session level.
Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session.
In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available to user until the browser is closed or there is session expiration.
Information is stored on the server.
used for the persistence of user-specific data on the server’s end.
SessionState can be cleared by programmer or user or in case of timeouts.

8• What is === operator?
Ans.
JavaScript Strict Equality Operator is used to compare two operands and return true if both the value and type of operands are the same. Since type conversion is not done, so even if the value stored in operands is the same but their type is different the operation will return false.
The === operator compares operands and returns true if both operands are of the same data type and have some value, otherwise, it returns false

9• How can the style/class of an element be changed?
Ans.
The add() method: It adds one or more classes.
The remove() method: It removes one or more classes.
The toggle() method: If the class does not exist it adds it and returns true.

10• How to read and write a file using JavaScript?
Ans.
1. file=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading the file content.
2. str = fread(file,flength(file)) ; The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file.
3. file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.

11• What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
Ans.
for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.


<br><br>


12• How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
Ans.
Using the parseInt() method
Using the Number() method
Using the Unary operator


<br><br>


13• What is the function of the delete operator?
Ans.
The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.


<br><br>


14• What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
Ans.
JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.


<br><br>


15• What is the use of Void (0)?
Ans.
You might have occasionally came across “javascript:void(0)” in an HTML Document. It is often used when inserting an expression in a web page might produce some unwanted effect. To remove this effect, “javascript:void(0)” is used. This expression returns undefined primitive value.


<br><br>


16• How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
Ans.
Approach: We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.

<br><br>


17• What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScripy?
Ans.
Event handlers attached to any DOM element are preserved.
Replacement is done everywhere.
It is not possible to append innerHTML.
Breaks the document.
Used for Cross-site Scripting.
